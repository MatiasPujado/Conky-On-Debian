---

## Configuration:

- `.conkyrc_pcstatus`: You will have to take a look at the Hard Drives/Partitions section and add or remove lines according to your needs.

- `.conkyrc_time-hs`: If you do not own a compatible device with **Headsetcontrol**, feel free to delete the last line from `conky.text` module.

```lua
 > ${alignc}${voffset 6}${execp $HOME/.config/conky/hs_battery-status.bash}
```

> **NOTE:**
>
> - Replace `enp4s0` string for the name of your Ethernet connection.
> - Use the following command to find out:

```shell
> ip a
```

Hope you enjoy it. :smile:
